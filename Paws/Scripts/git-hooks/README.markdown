This is a management-system for `git`'s shell-script hooks, based on [this Stack Overflow
response][so], and [these subsequent scripts][dotfiles] by [Henrik Nyh][].

You can install the hooks I've created here by running `npm run-script install-git-hooks`. (Any
hooks of your own will remain functional, but be moved to another name.)
